# Aisley Courier

Aisley Courier is the external Flutter/Dart application for Aisley Couriers. It is a Courier client, not a Customer, Seller, Admin, or Logistics dashboard.

The current app provides Courier authentication, account and vehicle management, policy consent, notifications, first-mile pickup, atomic final-mile dispatch-batch acceptance, task-bound final-mile hub handoff, Android rear-camera POD/browser file fallback, photo upload/COD completion intent, delivery history, and Logistics/Seller/Buyer task chat. The dashboard has separate read-only task previews while its backend aggregate remains a scaffold. Buyer composition is implemented for eligible accepted final-mile tasks; ended or denied threads remain read-only. Personal-vehicle selectors include `truck`, Seller pickups have bounded schedule filtering, registration/account forms protect unsaved changes, and Dashboard/delivery messages use plain-language recovery. Barcode scanning is implemented for Android and local Flutter web-server testing; Linux remains manual-input only for barcodes. Live batch/API, Logistics validation, and device/browser acceptance remain unverified. See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) and [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) for the current boundary.

The supplied backend documentation baseline is `4c3f504`, including Auth v2.6; Flutter implementation evidence remains recorded against `d7df220`. Flutter has no forgot-password flow, and Auth v2.6 integration remains outstanding. Documentation synchronization and local regression checks do not establish live backend or installed-device acceptance.

Frontend work follows the shared [Courier design guide](docs/design-courier.md): familiar Material interactions, consistent labels and navigation, and focused decisions based on Jakob's Law and Hick's Law. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) requires review of changed screens against those rules; feature specs continue to define the authorized workflow.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK compatible with the lockfile (Flutter >= 3.44.0, Dart >= 3.13.2 and < 4.0.0). The verified local and CI baseline is stable Flutter 3.47.2 / Dart 3.13.2.
- Git.
- A reachable Laravel API implementing the versioned `/api/v1` Courier contract.
- A platform toolchain for the target you want to run.

Check the local installation before setup:

```bash
flutter --version
flutter doctor -v
```

Official setup references:

- [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Linux desktop setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/setup)
- [Web setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/setup)
- [Windows desktop setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/windows/setup)

## Clone and configure

From the cloned repository root:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aisley_app
flutter pub get
flutter doctor -v
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

The app uses `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default, so the normal Linux development command remains `flutter run -d linux`. To use another API origin, pass the non-secret build setting with `--dart-define`; the app appends `/api/v1` itself, so do not include that suffix:

```bash
flutter run -d linux --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://192.0.2.10:8000
```

Append the same `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=...` option to another `flutter run` or `flutter build` command when that target needs a different origin. Use HTTPS outside local development. Dart defines are compiled into the client, so use them only for non-secret configuration such as the public API origin; never put passwords, bearer tokens, signing keys, provider credentials, or other secrets in them. The app does not read or bundle `.env` files.

If the Laravel API is running on another machine, use a development-machine address reachable from the target platform and configure the API's CORS policy for browser runs. The app shows a recoverable network state when the API is unavailable.

## Run on Linux desktop

Linux is the currently committed desktop runner and the normal local development target.

On Ubuntu/Debian, install the Flutter Linux and secure-storage prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libstdc++-12-dev \
  libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev gnome-keyring libjsoncpp-dev
```

### Linux secure storage and keyring

The app uses `flutter_secure_storage` for its bearer token. Linux needs both
the `libsecret` runtime/development packages and a running Secret Service
provider such as GNOME Keyring. Installing only the development package may
allow compilation but still cause secure-storage errors when the app starts.

After installing the packages, log out and back in so the desktop session can
start and unlock the keyring before running the app. On a non-GNOME session or
window manager, make sure its session startup provides a D-Bus user session and
starts a Secret Service provider. If the app reports that secure storage is
unavailable, check the session keyring before troubleshooting the API:

```bash
gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets
flutter run -d linux
```

Do not replace secure storage with plaintext files, ordinary preferences, or
hard-coded tokens. See the [`flutter_secure_storage_linux` requirements](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_secure_storage_linux/latest/)
for platform-specific alternatives and package details.

Enable and verify Linux desktop support:

```bash
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter devices
```

Run the app:

```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

Create a release build:

```bash
flutter build linux --release
```

## Run in a browser

The existing `web/` runner serves the **same Flutter Courier app** for local development and camera testing. It is not a separate Courier web dashboard. Use a fixed local origin so API CORS and camera permissions can be tested consistently:

```bash
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname localhost --web-port 8765
```

Open `http://localhost:8765` in your browser. Browser webcam access requires permission and a secure context such as localhost; a non-local browser test needs HTTPS. Allow the exact Flutter origin in the Laravel API's CORS configuration. See the [Flutter web-server guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/setup) and [browser camera requirements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia).

Camera scanning uses the shared Flutter scanner for QR and Code 128 tracking-ID candidates in the first-mile pickup flow. It fills the pickup input and never submits an action automatically. Final-mile proof is photo-only: Android uses a separate rear-camera still capture, while localhost web uses the file chooser. If scanner permission or browser support is unavailable, use manual first-mile input; do not use a plaintext token workaround. The API must allow the exact localhost origin for authenticated web testing.

The shared multipart sender now keeps Android/native readable-path uploads and uses bounded selected-file bytes in the browser. Registration evidence, profile photos, vehicle documents, and delivery photo POD use this platform-safe transport. Browser CORS/private-read behavior and installed-APK uploads still require runtime acceptance against a reachable API; build success alone does not verify either target. See the [cross-platform upload guide](docs/flutter-file-uploads.md), and allow the exact localhost origin plus the required upload/private-read preflights in the API.

## Run on Android and build an APK

Android uses the existing `android/` runner. To build an installable release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The output is `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`. The release APK includes camera permission, the first-mile QR/Code 128 scanner, and dedicated final-mile rear-camera still capture. Verify scanner and POD capture/permission states on an installed release APK; first-mile manual entry and POD file fallback remain available. A successful build alone does not prove either physical camera flow works.

## Run on Windows desktop

Windows desktop builds must be run on Windows. Install Flutter and Visual Studio with the **Desktop development with C++** workload; Visual Studio Code alone is not the Windows C++ toolchain.

This checkout does not include a `windows/` runner directory. Generate it once from the project root when working on Windows:

```powershell
flutter create --platforms=windows .
```

Enable and verify Windows desktop support:

```powershell
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter doctor -v
flutter devices
```

Run the app:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows
```

Create a release build:

```powershell
flutter build windows --release
```

## Useful development commands

[Courier quality checks](.github/workflows/flutter-quality.yml) runs on every push and pull request, with no branch or path filters, and supports manual dispatch from GitHub Actions. Its single `quality` job uses Ubuntu 24.04, a 15-minute timeout, read-only repository permissions, and cancellation of superseded runs on the same ref. It caches the Flutter SDK and dependencies; the dependency cache key includes the lockfile hash.

Run the same checks locally, in order:

```bash
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
flutter analyze --no-pub
flutter test --no-pub
```

Any failed command fails CI. [Lockfile enforcement](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get#enforce-lockfile) rejects an invalid dependency resolution or changed hosted-package hashes instead of silently updating dependencies. Formatting is excluded from CI. The existing mocked tests require no credentials or running Laravel API; passing CI does not establish live backend or installed-device acceptance. The hosted workflow remains unverified until it runs on GitHub.

Other local commands:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter devices
```

Keep API calls in the client/repository layers, keep bearer tokens in secure storage, and follow the rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing Courier behavior.
